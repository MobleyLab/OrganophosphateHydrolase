We generated fifty different docked poses using HYBRID; these poses can be found here: [`50-poses`](50-poses).
Then we visually inspected them using VIDA version 4.3.0 (OpenEye Inc.) to select the most dissimilar poses. We selected eleven different docked poses [`selected-poses`](selected-poses) with respect to the position of the substrate analog in the binding site.
