We used the following to run the MCPB.py program developed by Li and Merz (Li and Merz 2016) to determine the parameters of the OPH metal binding site.

1) MCPB.py –i 1HZY.in –s 1

This step generated the small, standard, and large models of the ion metal coordination sphere (more details are provided in Li and Merz 2016).

2) With the generated files, we use the small model to calculate the force constants and the large model to calculate the Merz-Kollman charges by Gaussian09. We used B3LYP/6-31g* level of theory to perform the Gaussian calculations. 

a) For the force constant calculations, there are two steps:
- QM geometry optimization
- Evaluation of the Cartesian Hessian matrix; this matrix will be used by the Seminario method to obtain force constants and is stored by Gaussian09 in the binary chk file.

b) For the Merz-kollman population analysis, we performed one calculation, in which the van der Waals (vdw) radii for metal ions were taken from Li and Merz 2016.

3) After performing the QM calculations, we run "MCPB.py -i 1HZY.in -s 2" to generate the final force constant parameters using the Seminario method.

4) Then, we run "MCPB.py -i 1HZY.in -s 3" to perform RESP charge fit to the large model and generate the mol2 files for the metal site residues.

5) Finally, run "MCPB.py -I 1HZY.in -s 4" to generate the PDB file with the renamed metal site residues and the leap source file for the system.

The input files used to run this protocol could be found in the subdirectory [mcpb-inputs] and the outputs corresponding to the metal site residues and the system generated using this protocol can be found in [mcpb-outputs].
