Here you will find the input files and parameters needed to generate AMBER simulations files for the WT OPH complexed with the docked pose generated by POSIT.

- [`input`](input): contains the input files needed to run [`leap.in`](leap.in)
- [`simulations-files`](simulations-files): contains the outputs generated by running [`leap.in`](leap.in). These outputs correspond to the solvated WT OPH complexed with paraoxon and they are used to run MD simulations in explicit solvent.
