Here you will find the input files and parameters needed to generate AMBER simulations files for the mutant OPH:D253E-H254R complexed with paraoxon.

- [`input`](input): contains the input files needed to run [`leap.in`](leap.in)
- [`simulations-files`](simulations-files): contains the outputs generated by running [`leap.in`](leap.in). These outputs correspond to the solvated OPH:D253E-H254R complex and they are used to run MD simulations in explicit solvent.
