We performed absolute binding free energy calculations on WT OPH complex and the mutant complexes OPH:D253E, OPH:D253E-H254R, OPH:D253-I255G, OPH:H254S, and OPH:I255S.

In the following subdirectories, we provide the input files as well as the yaml files used to run absolute binding free energy calculations on each of the 5 complexes in implicit solvent.

- [`WT`](WT)
- [`D253E`](D253E)
- [`D253E-H254R`](D253E-H254R)
- [`D253E-I255G`](D253E-I255G)
- [`H254S`](H254S)
- [`I255S`](I255S)

The AMBER files (.prmtop and .inpcrd files) reported in each subdirectory were generated using the same protocol described in [`MD-simulations`](../MD-simulations/MD-on-OPH_complexes).
